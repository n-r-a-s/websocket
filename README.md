# WebSocket Example integrated on Apache Tomcat

Implements server and a client communicating over the WebSocket protocol. The following features are demonstrated:
- Message created in one session seen on all other sessions
- Message removal on all sessions
- Message added and removed for specific sessions

This is an adaption from the Oracle tutorial:
Java EE 7: Building Web Applications with WebSocket, JavaScript and HTML5
